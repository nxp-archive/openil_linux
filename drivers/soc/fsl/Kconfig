	bool
	select SOC_BUS
	help
	  The global utilities block controls power management, I/O device
	  enabling, power-onreset(POR) configuration monitoring, alternate
	  function selection for multiplexed signals,and clock control.
	  This driver is to manage and access global utilities block.
	  Initially only reading SVR and registering soc device are supported.
	  Other guts accesses, such as reading RCW, should eventually be moved
	  into this driver as well.

	bool
	help
	  This driver configures a hardware FSM (Finite State Machine) for deep sleep.
	  The FSM is used to finish clean-ups at the last stage of system entering deep
	  sleep, and also wakes up system when a wake up event happens.
